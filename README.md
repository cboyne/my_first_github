In existentialism, possibility is one of the most important aspects of existence and different philosophers explore the realm of possibilities in different ways. German philosopher Martin Heidegger explores possibility in his concept of Dasein, and his structures and aspects of falling. French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, on the other hand, incorporates possibility in his discussion on freedom and nothingness, the relation between subject and object, and the two concrete attitudes towards others. Both philosophers work involves the possibility of death as well as how one’s own possibilities are affected and influenced by other beings of their own possibility. 
	For Heidegger, as outlined in his seminal work Being and Time, the concept of possibility is tied to human existence and the experience of being-in-the-world. He argues that human beings are characterized by their ability to project themselves into the future and make choices that determine their being and actions. This process of projection and choice, which he calls being-towards-death, is at the heart of human existence and allows for the experience of possibility. He describes beings in the world using a concept he calls Dasein, it is an abstract concept without one definition. But from his text, Dasein seems to refer to people or more specifically conscious beings or being that is open to being. Furthermore, the characteristics of Dasein are possible ways to be in the world and the essence of Dassin’s being is revealed through the possible ways it can be there in the world. When Dasein is authentic it is said to be of its own possibility, but even when it’s inauthentic it is still Dasein because inauthenticity only presents itself on the background of authenticity. The being of Dasein can be uncovered from everydayness, according to Heidegger one must observe Dasein in its everyday averageness since everyday task reveal the being of Dasein, and even hidden Dasein is still a possible way of being.
Mineness is a characteristic that is said to belong to the existence of Dasein and since each case of Dasein is said to be mine, it can be said that Dasein is my mineness which makes sense since being is always a question and issue for me. Since Dasein is an essential part of being and being involves being with others, the question of how Dasein interacts with others arises. According to Heidegger, being with others is a possibility of Dasein, but the who in Dasein can’t be disassociated with other who’s in Dasein. Similarly, not being with others is another possibility of Dasein because not being with is a way of being with. This concept can also be applied to care, care is a possibility of Dasein and even if one tries not to care that still represents a form of caring. One issue Heidegger encountered was constant care of other people creates a distance that takes me away from myself, but one of the essential parts of being myself is being with others. In the discussion of other, Heidegger refers to another concept he calls they and the they world, which is only concerned with averageness. To be they means to surrender one’s own possibilities and become part of they, furthermore my possibilities of being are in the they world and they world is part of Dasein’s way of being in the world. In Being and Time, Heidegger explores the concept of falling, which is one of the four structures of being in, the other structures are: understanding, state of mind, and discourse. He argues that these structures represent concrete ways of being in the world. Understanding refers to Dasein making sense of the world around it and interpret the phenomena observed. State of mind is the mood Dasein finds itself in and it is based on what we think and the situation around Dasein, mood also affects how we interpret the world. Discourse is another way of being in the world, also known as language, it constructs the world we live in with the words we use, as they leave our mouth they act in the world and affect it. The talk of the they is referred to as idle talk by Heidegger, and it is talk that is always bored and always curious and seeking newness, social media is a perfect example of idle talk incarnate.
Falling is the last of the structures, and it is an essential ontological structure of Dasein, there are four aspects to falling: temptation, alienation, tranquility, and entanglement. Falling is an essential part of being in, it refers to being absorbed in the public aspect of the they and it’s a positive possibility of Dasein. Although positive, it is an expression of inauthenticity of Dasein, but it is not a lessening of Dasein’s value or reducing its meaning, since we spend most of our lives in inauthenticity. According to Heidegger, I am always already falling, as soon as one is Dasein then one is falling. Falling is an irresistible temptation to Dasein; social media, idle talk, and public averageness are all tempting to Dasein’s being. Tranquility comes from the they world to Dasein that everything is alright and as it should be, it is the base background of falling and provides comfort to Dasein, but also takes it away from its own being. Alienation is my own possibilities being taken away from me by the they, it is when my own possibilities become alienated like Albert Camus’ idea of false hope. Entanglement is when my own possibilities are replaced with the possibilities of the they world, this entanglement involves being entangled by the they world from myself, since it is me who is falling in the they world. When discussing possibilities, at one point one must confront the inescapable possibility which is death, according to Heidegger, there is an authentic certainty to death. He describes the concept of being towards death which is the possibility of authenticity, the possibility of my impossibility, or the inescapable possibility of Dasein. Being towards death does not refer to suicide or dwelling on one’s death, and it does not prevent other possibilities. It is an anticipation of the possibility, the closer we get to the possibility the more possible it becomes, anticipation of possibility implies living in anxiety which represents authentic being towards the end of one’s own possibilities.
	For Sartre, as outlined in his work Being and Nothingness, the concept of possibility is linked to the nature of consciousness and the experience of freedom. He argues that consciousness creates a separation between the self and involves not only identity but difference. It is characterized by its ability to imagine and consider different courses of action, and that this ability is what gives rise to the experience of freedom. This freedom, in turn, allows for the experience of possibility, as it allows the individual to choose from a range of possible actions and outcomes. Sartre describes two aspects being, being-in-itself which refers to the inherit nature or essence of a thing, and being-for-itself which is consciousness and nothingness. He describes the experience of existence as a nauseating endless paste, but for there to be freedom there must be things that might not be what they are. This Freedom is essential nothingness and for nothingness to be in the world man must be able to inject his nothingness into the world, man is nothingness, and this nothingness is his freedom. Being flows like lava and time is an uninterrupted flow from the past to the future, nothingness creates a break in the flow and causes a break between the being and past, and the being and future. Anxiety stemming from one’s future is an example of the experience of nothing or freedom. While freedom increases ones owns possibilities it can also take the form of desire which leads to bad faith, Sartre also explore this idea which takes the individual out of nothingness. Bad faith can be examined by looking at the quote “I am what I am”, this statement eliminates the characteristics of nothingness which removes the freedom. This leads to falling out of transcendence and into facticity, which is like the they world, Sartre refers to people in bad faith as salauds or people without room for change. Although, he also states that in bad faith nothingness still exist because it is always me playing an object and I’m still conscious. As with all philosophies Sartre had to deal with how conscious beings interact with each other in the world, which he explores through the concept of the look and the relation between subject and object. The subject would be considered being-for-itself since it is constantly aware of itself and its consciousness, whereas the object is in a state of being-for-itself. According to Sartre, to be in the world with others means to be open to the possibility of being seen by others, specifically being seen as an object by another subject. The look always involves one subject and one object, it is never an object looking at an object or a subject looking at a subject, the look he refers to is not made with the eyes but it’s the awareness of being looked at. Sartre explores two concrete attitudes towards others; the first is love, language and masochism; the second is indifference, desire, hate, and sadism. Love in this context, is attempting to assimilate the others freedom to recover myself, so I make myself into an object that will attract the other. Language is the seduction that I am, according to Sartre, it turns the other into an object but is still able to preserve its subjectivity. Masochism is the ultimate expression of failure since I am making myself into an object and forcing the other to make me an object, which is objectifying them at the same time. Since my being is found in another subject, by taking them as an object I no longer exist. Indifference is when the other is always just an object and you get thrown back into your own nothingness. For Sartre, desire is me and I am the desire, it takes me over and I am desire incarnate, he says that the flesh is the body infused with desire and when one attempts to caress, they are trying to solicit desire in the other body. An object of desire wants to turn the other into an object of desire or wants their conscious. Extreme desire leads to sadism, and extreme sadism leads to hate which involve objectifying the other. All these elements involve making me either an object or a subject and making the other the opposite, which is how Sartre describes the inter-human relationship. For Sartre, death is not a possibility, it is always a possibility and always sneaks up on us. Even when expected it takes us by surprise, it’s always absurd and it’s the destruction of our possibilities. It is the ultimate form of freedom, as it is the moment the self is completely free from the constraints of the world.
In both Heidegger and Sartre's philosophies, possibility is seen as an essential aspect of human experience. For Heidegger, it arises from the human capacity for projection and choice, while for Sartre, it arises from the experience of freedom and consciousness. In both cases, possibility is closely tied to the nature of being and existence, and plays a central role in their respective philosophical systems.
